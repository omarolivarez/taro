## What problem it solves
When using fitness or nutrition apps, the apps use models that hold true for the general population, but not for me as an individual. I have specific body chemistry that is tough for any one app to capture. Therefore, existing apps are unable to provide accurate recommendations for me to maintain good fitness.

## How it solves it
taro uses a linear regression to monitor daily entries in my consumption and exercise to communicate the biggest factors to weight loss.
